##### DEFINE THE PROBLEM #####

Demultiplexing is the step in processing where we use index information to know which sequences came from which sample after they
had all been sequence together. Four FASTQ files are provided for this problem. Using the index-pairs, we have to piece together the 
records of the two biological read files and determine whether specific records reach a minimum quality value or if they're of a
known index.

##### DEFINE THE OUTPUT #####

The output should include 52 files. 

24 R1 FASTQ files, one for each index.
24 R2 FASTQ files, one for each index.
2 non-matching pair files for R1 and R4.
2 low quality index read files for R1 and R4.

##### THE FOLLOWING IS MY PSEUDOCODE #####

* import itertools library and islice

* file_names_dict <- create a library that holds indexes as keys and file names as values.

def reverse_complement(dna_string):
	'''Takes a string of DNA characters and determine
	   the reverse complement.'''

	* Create a string variable called reverse_complement
	* Iterate through each character of the dna_string input within a for loop. Replace 'A' with 'T' and 'G' with 'C'. Append 
	  each swapped character to the reverse_complement string.
	* Reverse the reverse_complement string to get the reverse complement of the input.

	return reverse_complement

def is_known_index(index1):
	'''Takes the index from read2.txt and determines if they exist within the 24 libraries in the 24_index_list'''

	if index1 contains the character 'N' it means it is an unknown index:
		return False
	if index1 is in the 24_index_list it means its a known index.
		return True	

def is_index_pair(index1, index2):
	'''Takes two indexes and determines if the reverse complement of one index matches the other index.''
	
	* index2_reverse_comp <- call the reverse_complement function and pass it index2 as an input, store the return string in this variable.

	* If index2_reverse_comp is equivalent to index1, return True. Otherwise return False.


* read1 <- create variable to store and open read1.txt
* read2 <- variable to store and open read2.txt
* read3 <- variable to store and open read3.txt
* read4 <- variable to store and open read4.txt

* num_matched_indexes <- set this variable to 0 and increment when a matched index is found per index-pair.
* num_index_hopping <- set this variable to 0 and increment when an index hop is found per index-pair.
* unknown_index <-  set this variable to 0 and increment when an index hop is found per unknown index-pair.

while True:

	* dna1_record <- call the islice method from the itertools library to slice out four lines of read1 and covert these lines into a list of four elements
	* dna2_record <- call the islice method from the itertools library to slice out four lines of read4 and covert these lines into a list of four elements
	* index1_record <- call the islice method from the itertools library to slice out four lines of read2 and covert these lines into a list of four elements
	* index2_record <- call the islice method from the itertools library to slice out lines of read3 and covert these lines into a list of four elements

	* biological_read1 <- extract the biological read from the dna1_record (dna1_record[1])
	* biological_read2 <- extract the biological read from the dna2_record (dna2_record[1])
	* index1 <- extract the index read from index1_record (index1_record[1])
	* index2 <- extract the index read from index2_record (index2_record[1])

	* index_pair <- Create this variable to hold the index-pair for the header of your reads. Append index1 to index2 with a '-' separator

	if the "is_known_index(index1_record[1])" method call returns False do the following:
		* Increment the unknown_index by 1.
		* Add the first biological read (dna1_record[1]) and second biological read (dna2_record[1]) into the non-matching index pair files.
		* Continue to the next iteration of the while loop.

	if the "is_index_pair(index1, index2)" method call returns True do the following:

		* A matched index pair is found, increment num_matched_indexes by 1.
		* Append the index_pair into the header line of each record (the first object of dna1_record and dna2_record).

		* Run a for loop to append the record lines from dna1_record and dna2_record into their corresponding forward and reverse
		  FASTQ files. This step essentially writes the records with the index-pair header back into the FASTQ files. The name of 
	          the file will be determined by running the index through a dictionary using regular expressions.

	else do the following:
		
		* This is a non-matching index pair so it is index-hopped. Increment the num_index_hopping by one.
		* This else statement is reached when non matching index pairs are found.
		* Append the index_pair into the header line of each record (the first object of dna1_record and dna2_record).

		* Run a for loop to append the record lines from dna1_record and dna2_record into their corresponding forward and reverse
		  non-matching index-pair FASTQ files. This step essentially writes the records with the index-pair header back into the 
		  FASTQ files.

	if the dna1_record list is an empty list do the following:
		* Break out of the while loop. This means the islice method has reached the end of the 4 FASTQ Files.
